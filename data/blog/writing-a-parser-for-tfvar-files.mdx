summary: A short note about writing a terraform parser for tfvar files.
---

I recently wrote a small library to parse tfvar files, or hcl files, for jdk languages. I wrote the library in kotlin, and it's just two files, with a lot of tests.

I'll write more on this later, but I really wanted it to be simple, and low/no dependencies.
